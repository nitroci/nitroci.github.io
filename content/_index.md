Boost your software Development, Continuous Integration and Deployment with Nitro CI.

Nitro CI aims to create workspaces which implement commands that can be executed in the local development environment as well as in CI and CD environments.

No more README files to document the commands to be executed by the developer.

Workspace can be componsed in a hierarchical way and they are not tied to a single git repository hence a workspace can be composed by multiple git repositories and there is no limit to have just one workspace for each git repository.

A workspace can be used with any type of project and it is not tied to a particolar programming language. This approach plays quite well and shines with Cloud Native and Microservices applications as they require complex automation.

The stack can be extended to include your preferred DevOps tools.
