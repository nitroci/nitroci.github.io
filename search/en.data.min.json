This is not limited to shell commands but it enbales practices to manage environments, encryption, pipelines and much more.\nJust to be clear no more README files to document the commands and deployment procedures to be executed by either the developer or the release manager.\nWorkspace can be composed in a hierarchical way and they are not tied to a single git repository hence a workspace can be composed by multiple git repositories and there is no limit to have just one workspace for each git repository.\nA workspace can be used with any type of project and it is not tied to a particolar programming language. This approach plays quite well and shines with Cloud Native, Microservices and Serverless applications as they require complex automation. For instance a developer using K8S locally (K3d, K3s, Kind, MicroK8s, and MiniKube) is able to test the complete CI and CD process on its own local development.\nThe stack can be extended to include your preferred DevOps tools (For instance CI \u0026amp; CD tools and Package Manager as long as they expose any kind of Api for the integration).\n"},{"id":39,"href":"/tags/","title":"Tags","parent":"Nitro CI","content":""}]
